Mr. Roboger's Neighborhood: 
  A web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number changing all digits with "1"s to "Beep!", all digits "2"s to "Boop!" and all digits with 3's to "Won't you be my neighbor?". 

  These exceptions are written from least to most important.
